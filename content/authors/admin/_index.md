I am an ecologist and I work on applied ecology and conservation science projects in the Indian context. I like introducing data from diverse, non-traditional sources with scientific rigour to conservation and allied disciplines. My work has been with a diverse set of conservation professionals, ranging from scientists and NGOs to data journalists and litigating lawyers. I used to be an engineer in my previous life.

I am well versed with data analysis and visualization {{< icon name="chart-area" pack="fas" >}} using {{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}}, and with large satellite and derived geospatial data analysis {{< icon name="globe" pack="fas" >}}{{< icon name="drafting-compass" pack="fas" >}} using [Google Earth Engine](earthengine.google.com).
